Console tool to automate Java updating and uninstalling. 
And cause my first idea of fjava might not fly when pushing to thousands of users.

# Why?
In a mixed on / off domain enviroment I need a easy way to automate installing 32bit Java and uninstalling old versions while bypassing the Built in Jave update. Users in these enviroments do not have the abuilty to install software. This can be scheduled to run silent /s on user machines and installs disabeling the auto update. Why not another way? If I had that option this would not be here.
